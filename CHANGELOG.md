## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-27

### 🐛 Fixed

- **mermaid-cli invocation** — removed spurious `mmdc` subcommand from all generated render scripts (`render-pdf.sh`, `export-diagram.sh`). `npx -y @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` runs the binary directly; passing `mmdc` as an argument caused a runtime error reported in production.
- **Puppeteer browser path** — `render-pdf.sh` and `export-diagram.sh` now auto-detect `PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH` from `~/.cache/puppeteer` before invoking `npx`. Without this, `mermaid-cli` failed with _"Failed to launch the browser process!"_ because `npx` runs in an isolated cache with no access to the system Puppeteer browser.

### ✨ Added (VS Code Extension)

- **Custom MCP Server form** — sidebar UI now lets users register arbitrary third-party MCP servers (stdio or HTTP transport) with name, command/args/env vars, or URL.
- **Dynamic CLI detection banners** — removed static HTML banner elements; banners are now created by JS at detection time, eliminating flash-of-unstyled content and timing issues.
- **Spinner during CLI check** — loading state shown while `sf` binary is resolved on activation.
- **Shell PATH fallback chain** — extension resolves `sf` via `-lc` → `-ilc` → known install paths (npm-global, Homebrew, volta) to handle stripped `PATH` environments.
- **MCP org detection by args** — `readConfiguredServers` now inspects the `--orgs` argument in any mcp.json entry rather than requiring a specific key naming convention.

### 📝 Documentation

- Updated profile counts and added missing AI, Slack, Tableau, and Project Manager entries across `docs/index.html` and `docs/profiles.html`.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-27

### ✨ Added

- **8 new role profiles** — completing the full profile matrix:
  - Tier 2: `service` (Service Cloud), `cpq` (CPQ Specialist), `omnistudio` (OmniStudio/Vlocity), `fsl` (Field Service)
  - Tier 3: `ai` (AI/Agentforce Specialist), `slack` (Slack Developer Bolt.js), `tableau` (Tableau/Analytics Cloud)
  - QA scaffold: `src/utils/salesforce-auth.ts` + `src/utils/salesforce-api.ts` generated when running `--profile qa`
- **Salesforce Playwright utilities scaffold** — `sf setup-agents local --profile qa` now writes two utility files into the user's project:
  - `salesforce-auth.ts`: `getSalesforceOrgInfo()`, `navigateWithCLISession()`, `useSalesforceCLISession()` via `execFileSync` (no shell interpolation, no DOM cookies)
  - `salesforce-api.ts`: `executeSoqlQuery()`, `createRecord()`, `updateRecord()`, `deleteRecord()` (Bearer token from SF CLI)
- **`session-from-cli.md` workflow** — QA profile gains a new workflow covering 3 authentication patterns (navigation, context-only, fixture) and CI/CD env var usage
- **78 new unit tests** — profile detect/ruleContent/workflows coverage for all 8 new profiles + generator tests

### 📝 Documentation

- `docs/user-guide/profiles.md` — updated profile count to 22, added table rows and detail sections for all 8 new profiles

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### ✨ Added

- **10 role profiles** — `developer`, `architect`, `ba`, `mulesoft`, `ux`, `cgcloud`, `devops`, `qa`, `crma`, `data360`
- **`--profile` flag** — comma-separated profile selection for non-interactive environments
- **Interactive multi-select prompt** — checkbox-based role selection powered by `@inquirer/prompts`
- **Auto-detection** — profiles pre-selected based on project signals:
  - `cgcloud__` in `package.xml` → CGCloud profile (with confirm prompt)
  - `WaveDashboard` / `WaveDataflow` in `package.xml` → CRMA profile
  - `DataStream` / `DataModelObject` in `package.xml` → Data Cloud profile
  - `.github/workflows` / `azure-pipelines.yml` → DevOps profile
  - `playwright.config.ts/js` → QA profile
  - `mule-artifact.json` / `pom.xml` → MuleSoft profile
- **`sub-agent-protocol.mdc`** — always generated; maps task types to active profiles with handover checklist
- **Per-profile `.mdc` rule files** — one dedicated Cursor rule file per selected role
- **Salesforce standards base rule** — `salesforce-standards.mdc` written for all Salesforce projects (independent of profiles)
- **`.vscode/extensions.json`** — profile extension union written for Salesforce projects
- **Cursor rule scope prompt** — choose between project-level `.mdc` or user-level instructions (Salesforce projects only)
- **Default profile fallback** — uses `developer` with a warning when no profile is selected in non-TTY
- **`src/profiles/` module system** — each profile is a standalone TypeScript module exporting `id`, `label`, `ruleFile`, `ruleContent()`, `extensions`, and optional `detect()`

### 🔧 Changed

- `setupCursor()` — refactored to async; delegates rule content to profile modules
- `setupVsCode()` — now builds a union of extensions from all active profiles
- `SetupLocalResult` — extended with `profiles: ProfileId[]`
- `messages/setup.local.md` — added 7 new message keys for profile prompts and defaults

### 📦 Dependencies

- Added `@inquirer/prompts` for checkbox and confirm interactive prompts
